# dirsync

Dirsync is a simple little tool to back up files and directories from the local
file system to another location in the file system (presumably a mounted
network share.)  

It accepts a json-encoded configuration file on the command line.  The json is a
list of source and destination specifications, like this:

```json
  [
    {   "source": "/users/me/documents"
      , "destination": "/Volumes/remote_mount_point/documents"
      , "ignore": ["personal", "image.png"]
    }
  ]
```
The `ignore` list is just a literal match right now.  Wildcards/globbing are not
supported yet.  So in the example above a directory or file named "personal"
would be skipped.

## Building and Installing

`stack build`
`stack install`

Will install the binary in ~/.local/bin


## Running

`dirsync path/to/dirsync.conf`



## For running as daemon on Mac OS X

I have been unable to get this to work as a LaunchAgent, so I'm running this
as a cron job for now.  But below are some notes I grabbed about setting
up a LaunchAgent.

For a complete listing of the keys, see the launchd.plist manual page.

The appropriate location for executables that you launch from your job is
/usr/local/libexec

You indicate whether it describes a daemon or agent by the directory you place
it in. Property list files describing daemons are installed in
/Library/LaunchDaemons, and those describing agents are installed in
/Library/LaunchAgents or in the LaunchAgents subdirectory of an individual
userâ€™s Library directory.

### Debugging launchd Jobs

There are some options that are useful for debugging your launchd job.

The following example enables core dumps, sets standard out and error to go to a
log file, and instructs launchd to temporarily increase the debug level of its
logging while acting on behalf of your job (remember to adjust your syslog.conf
accordingly):
